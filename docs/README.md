Adieu Template Files
====================

Template files are used to "rollup" multiple ad sizes into a single file.

## Usage

To use the templates, simple make sure to place your rads into the boxes that correspond to the ad sizes. [Adieu.io](http://www.adieu.io) will pluck out the images from the template as appropriate.

## Ad sizes

For more information on standard ad sizes, see the http://www.iab.net.
